# Applying Machine Learning to Predict Athelete Performance from Activity Tracker Data 
This reports presents Practical Machine Learning Project that involves applying various machine learning algorithms to Human Activity Recognition dataset to predict the quality of excercise based on the acquired raw data by activity tracker. More precisely, the Weight Lifting Exercises Dataset has been used to predict the movement of athlete and how likely they mistake during repetition of certain barbell weight lifting movement. 

The results of the analysis has been presented in the .HTML and .Rmd files present in this repository.
